Start the Python ServerBashpython app.py
The server will start at http://localhost:50002. Access the Web InterfaceOpen your browser and visit http://localhost:50003. Start InteractingClick "Feed" to increase energyClick "Play" to increase happiness valueClick "Pet" to soothe the petObserve how environmental changes affect the pet's emotion🎨 System Working PrincipleData FlowSensor Acquisition → Arduino reads all sensor dataSerial Communication → Data is sent to Python via USBData Processing → Python calculates the emotional stateWebSocket Push → Web interface is updated in real-timeFeedback Control → Controls LED and Servo responses and Buzzer tone/rhythmEmotion AlgorithmPythonEmotion_Value = Temp_Comfort_Score * 0.3 + Light_Comfort_Score * 0.3 + 
                Happiness_Value * 0.3 + Interaction_Frequency * 0.1
LED Color Mapping🟢 Green: Very Happy (Emotion Value $\ge$ 80)🔵 Blue: Happy (Emotion Value $\ge$ 60)🟡 Yellow: Normal (Emotion Value $\ge$ 40)🔴 Red: Gloomy (Emotion Value < 40)🔧 Custom ConfigurationModify Sensor ThresholdsAdjust the following in app.py:Python# Temperature Comfort Range
